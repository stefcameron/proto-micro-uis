    TODO: I couldn't figure-out how to force Webpack to bundle the Vue runtime
     when nothing in the main app references Vue (since it's only app2, which
     is dynamically loaded at runtime). The Internet doesn't seem to know how
     to do this. Perhaps it's super simple, but this was the easiest hack I
     could think of to get the prototype running.
